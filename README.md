# 📱 Overview

**Offline AI Assistant** is a modern Android application that brings powerful AI directly to your device.

Unlike cloud-based AI assistants, every conversation runs locally using **GGUF language models** powered by **llama.cpp**, ensuring your chats remain private and accessible even without an internet connection.

Once a model is downloaded, all AI inference happens completely on-device.

Designed with a privacy-first approach, the app provides a smooth and modern chat experience while supporting multiple open-source language models.

# 📦 Package Overview

| Package | Responsibility |
|----------|----------------|
| **ai** | Local LLM inference, JNI bridge, GGUF support, model loading & generation |
| **data** | Repository implementations, Room database, DataStore, downloads |
| **domain** | Business logic, repository contracts and use cases |
| **ui** | Jetpack Compose screens, ViewModels, navigation and theming |
| **di** | Dependency injection using Hilt |
| **utils** | Helper classes including RAM checks, exporters and download utilities |

---

# 🏗️ Architecture Principles

This project follows modern Android development best practices.

### MVVM

Each screen is backed by its own ViewModel exposing immutable UI state through **StateFlow**.

### Clean Architecture

Responsibilities are separated into Presentation, Domain and Data layers, making the project easier to maintain and extend.

### Repository Pattern

Repositories act as the single source of truth while hiding implementation details from the presentation layer.

### Dependency Injection

Hilt is used to provide dependencies throughout the application.

### Reactive UI

The UI is completely reactive using:

- StateFlow
- Coroutines
- Jetpack Compose

### Offline-First

After downloading a model, all AI inference happens locally without requiring internet access.

### Native AI Integration

The application integrates **llama.cpp** through JNI to perform efficient on-device inference using GGUF models.

# 🚀 Getting Started

## Prerequisites

Before building the project, install:

- Android Studio Narwhal or newer
- Android SDK
- Android NDK
- CMake
- JDK 17+

---

## Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/its-hazratbilal/offline-ai-assistant.git
```

Open the project in Android Studio.

---

## Native Build Requirements

This project compiles **llama.cpp** from source using the Android NDK.

Ensure the following SDK components are installed:

- Android NDK
- CMake

The first build may take a few minutes while the native library is compiled.

---

## Build & Run

Simply run the **app** module on an Android device.

A physical device is recommended for the best AI performance.

Minimum SDK: **30**

Target SDK: **37**

After launching the app:

1. Select an AI model.
2. Download the model.
3. Wait for the model to finish loading.
4. Start chatting completely offline.

---

# 📦 Download

Prebuilt APKs are available from the GitHub Releases page.

👉 **Releases**

https://github.com/its-hazratbilal/offline-ai-assistant/releases

---

# 🧪 Tested On

The application has been tested on Android devices running Android 11 and above.

Performance depends on:

- Device RAM
- CPU performance
- Selected GGUF model size

Larger models provide better responses but require more memory.

# 🙏 Acknowledgements

A huge thank you to the amazing open-source community and projects that made this application possible.

Special thanks to:

- **llama.cpp** — Fast and efficient on-device LLM inference
- **GGUF** — Standard format for quantized language models
- **Google** — Gemma open models
- **Alibaba Cloud** — Qwen models
- **TinyLlama** contributors
- **SmolLM2** contributors
- **Hugging Face** — Model hosting and distribution
